# React UI pairing exercise

This is a pairing exercise for prospective software engineers.

The aim is to create a responsive table similar to the screenshot in [`portfolio.png`](portfolio.png).

The candidate can guide the exercise and do as much as is feasible within the time limit (~40-45 minutes).

## System prerequisites

This app assumes you have the following installed globally:

1. nvm
2. yarn (or npm)


## Set up

Checkout a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b some-branch-name
```

Install the dependencies and run the app:

```bash
nvm use
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can verify the application is running correctly by visiting [`http://localhost:5174`](http://localhost:5174).

## Running the tests
Run the tests in watch-mode by running:

```bash
yarn test
```

## Notes
* All code should be written test-first (TDD)
* The candidate can Google things or ask for help
* The `main` branch should be kept clean
