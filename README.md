# 👩‍💻👨‍💻 React UI pairing exercise

This is a pairing exercise for prospective software engineers.

The aim is to create a responsive table similar to the screenshot in [`dashboard.png`](dashboard.png).

The candidate should guide the exercise and do as much as is feasible within the time limit (~40-45 minutes).

## 💻 System prerequisites

This app assumes you have the following installed globally:

1. [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
2. [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/))

## 📚 Set up

Install the dependencies and run the app:

```bash
nvm use
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can verify the application is running correctly by visiting [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173).

## 🧪 Running the tests

Run the tests in watch-mode by running:

```bash
yarn test --watch
```

## 📝 Notes

- All code should be written test-first (TDD)
- The candidate can Google things or ask for help
- The candidate can install libraries to help complete the exercise if they wish
- The `main` branch should be kept clean
